## üõ†Ô∏è Features Implemented

### 1. Mood Input
- User provides their current mood via a Streamlit text box.

### 2. Story & Activity Generation (LangChain + Bedrock)
- **LangChain PromptTemplate + LLMChain** used for:
  - Generating a **short creative story** reflecting the mood.
  - Suggesting **real-life activities** that match the mood.
- **SequentialChain** combines both steps so one input (`mood`) generates multiple outputs (`story`, `activity`).

### 3. Database (SQLite)
- **Schema:**
mood_id | date_time | mood_text | story_theme | activity_theme
