In Git, the term "upstream" refers to the main branch from which a given branch was branched off of and to which it may eventually push changes to. By default, Git uses "origin" as the remote name for the upstream repository, but you can configure this to any name.

What is a Pull Request?
It allows others to review your code before it gets merged into the main branch.

Using Git for Code Review
# See changes in working directory
git diff

# See staged changes
git diff --cached

# Compare two branches
git diff main feature-branch

# See changes in specific file
git diff main feature-branch -- filename.js

# Show word-level changes
git diff --word-diff

# Show statistics
git diff --stat

# Ignore whitespace changes
git diff -w

# Show only file names
git diff --name-only


View commit history:# Basic log
git log

git log --oneline -> # One line per commit


# Show graph
git log --graph --oneline

# Show changes in each commit
git log -p

# Show specific file history
git log -- filename.js



Use merge:

In team workflows to keep all contributors' history

When commit authorship and context are important

Use rebase:

Before pushing (especially solo work) to clean up

When you want a tidy, linear Git history
